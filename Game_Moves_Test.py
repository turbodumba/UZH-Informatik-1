# You are supposed to develop the functionality in a test-driven way.
# Think about relevant test cases and extend the following test suite
# until all requirements of the description are covered. The test suite
# will be run against various correct and incorrect implementations, so
# make sure that you only test the `move` function and stick strictly
# to its defined signature.
#
# Make sure that you define test methods and that each method
# _directly_ includes an assertion in the body, or -otherwise- the
# grading will mark the test suite as invalid.
